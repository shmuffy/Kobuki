# PID Controller Implementation on Kobuki Robot

Contains the implementation of a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller on a Kobuki robot, using LiDAR to detect walls and follow a path generated by motion planning. The project was developed and tested in a ROS (Robot Operating System) environment, first using Gazebo simulations and then in a real-world environment on a Linux system.

# Introduction
This project demonstrates the implementation of a PID controller for a Kobuki robot to follow a predetermined path while using LiDAR sensors to detect and avoid walls. The project leverages ROS for robot control and Gazebo for simulations, providing a complete workflow from simulation to real-world deployment.

# Features

- **PID Control**: Decently accurate control of the Kobuki robot's movement.

- **LiDAR Sensing**: Real-time wall detection and avoidance.

- **Motion Planning**: Path planning and following using ROS.

- **Simulation and Real-World Testing**: Validated in both simulated and real environments.

# PID Controller
The PID controller is implemented in controller.py and is responsible for adjusting the robot's velocity to follow the desired path. It continuously calculates the error between the robot's current position and the target path, adjusting the control inputs to minimize this error.

# Extra Motion Planning
A* Pathfinding 
Additional script implements the A* pathfinding algorithm to navigate a grid with obstacles. Below is an overview of the main functions:

- **neighbors**: Returns a list of neighboring nodes for a given node.

- **heuristic_distance**: Computes the Euclidean distance between a candidate node and the goal node. 
                          (You could also implement Manhattan, Chebyshev, Minkowski, etc.) 

- **get_path_from_A_star**: Implements the A* algorithm to find the shortest path 
                            from the start node to the goal node, avoiding obstacles.
